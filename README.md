# Dynamic_TODO_List
This is the dynamic ToDo List, in which url is public (deployed online - herokuApp), database is mongoDB and based on node, express &amp; mongoose.

### How to add a new list?
- for now, you can use this on localhost. So just write your listName in url after localhost:3000.
- for example: localhost:3000/homeList
- this will create and redirect to your new list named as "homeList"

### Adding a new feature
A webpage that will show all the lists you have created and ofcourse linked to those lists
